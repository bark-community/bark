# BARK Token (BARK)
v2.0 (Under Construction)

BARK is a token-2022 standard asset on the Solana blockchain, evolving from a meme token to a meticulously crafted real-world asset.

## Overview

BARK ensures transparent, secure, and community-driven financial operations by merging blockchain efficiency with tangible asset values. Leading in decentralized finance and social finance, BARK supports charitable causes through transaction fees and operates under democratic governance. The community actively shapes its future through proposals and voting, while tiered CNFT memberships provide exclusive benefits and enhance engagement.

## Features

- **Transparent and Secure Operations**: Utilizing the Solana blockchain for efficient and reliable transactions.
- **Community-Driven Governance**: The BARK Protocol is governed democratically through community proposals and voting.
- **Charitable Contributions**: A portion of transaction fees is allocated to support charitable causes.
- **Dynamic Transaction Fees**: Basic fee is 2.8%, with a maximum of 5%. Fees are used for ecosystem development, BARK payback (inflationary measures), charity campaigns, or can be burned. All fees are subject to governance and voting processes.
- **Tiered CNFT Memberships**: Exclusive benefits and rewards based on membership tiers to enhance community engagement.

## Disabled Features

- **Interest Bearing Rate**: Initially set to offer a 5% interest rate to incentivize long-term holding of BARK, providing instant returns and helping stabilize the token economy, this feature is currently disabled due to compliance issues.

## Current Limitations

- **Raydium.io Compatibility**: Some Solana extensions and token-2022 features are not currently compliant with DEXs like Raydium.io. This affects the liquidity pool and requires program updates, audits, and dApp modifications on Raydium.io.

## Compliance and Future Updates

Due to non-compliance of some Solana extensions and token-2022 features with decentralized exchanges like Raydium.io, certain features are disabled for security reasons. Future updates and additional features will be implemented as these platforms support new token extensions and meet compliance requirements.
